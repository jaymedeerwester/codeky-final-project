		  <p class="intro-text">Hi, my name is Jayme Deerwester. Although I grew up with a bunch of dalmatians and a laundry list of other dog breeds, hounds hold a special place in my heart.</p>
		  <p class="intro-text">But apparently, I'm in the minority because a disproportionate number of hounds end up in shelters or simply dumped, especially if they don't take to hunting.</p>
<p class="intro-text">Our first hound, a beagle creatively named Dog, wandered to our house from a hunting kennel up the road. Because he could care less about hunting, the owners of the kennel never bothered to track him down. Our gain, their loss.</p>
		  <p class="intro-text">About 20 years later, my sister found a skinny beagle mix in Daniel Boone National Forest that she dubbed Yeti after the mountain bike she'd been riding that day. Yeti appeared in front of her car as she was leaving the parking lot. My sister waited for her to clear the road and slowly started driving. But Yeti kept following the car. Her passenger opened the car door, Yeti hopped in and they headed off to the Wendy's drive-thru where the skinny year-old dog enjoyed a single and fries. About a month later, she came to live with me in Northern Virginia and later back home in Kentucky. We were inseparable until 2021, when she developed an aggressive case of lymphoma and I had to make the excruciating decision to put her to sleep.</p>
		<p class="intro-text">A year later, I was finally ready for a new dog. I was toying with getting a dachshund or Jack Russell Terrier when the universe conspired to pair me with another hound. My vet's wife called to say they'd found an abandoned coonhound mix tied to a post outside the clinic with a bag of dog food. Did I want to come meet her?</p>
		<p class="intro-text">"Why not?" I figured, and headed to meet my next hound. I'd been told she was "about the size of Yeti," who came up to my knees and weighed about 25 pounds. That description could not have been more inaccurate. This dog was more than twice as tall and weighed twice as much. She was also a spaz. If I'd gone to a shelter or adoption event, I'm not sure I would have picked her. </p>
		<p class="intro-text">But having done some photography work for a rescue group, I knew coonhounds are frequently dumped in the South, where they risk being sent to a high-kill shelter. They're also stubborn and sensitive, which can frustrate an inexperienced dog owner. If these dogs are lucky, they get transported to cities like Washington, where they might have a better chance of being adopted. She was also black, which is often another strike against a dog hoping to find a home. For those reasons, I was hesitant to make her take her chances in a shelter around here.</p> 
		<p class="intro-text">I decided to keep her. I named her Rojas after Dani Rojas, the Mexican soccer player from "Ted Lasso" because her personality reminded me of that character: sweet, sensitive slightly derpy and very athletic. It quickly became apparent that whoever owned her before me taught her to fetch. To paraphrase Dani Rojas, to her, Chuckit ball is life. (Curiously, while her previous owner taught her to fetch, they didn't spend nearly as much time house-training her. She was the hardest dog I've ever housebroken, bar none.)
		</p>
		<p class="intro-text">Rojas and I marked a year together in February 2023. I'm not going to lie: It has been rough at times. Having recently turned two, she's finally beginning to settle down -- a little, anyway. She can finally go more than two hours without having to pee, though I have to stop her from bringing a toy and leaving it in the yard every time I take her out. She also has an irritating habit of lying across my bed, giving me about a foot of space in which to sleep. But whenever I look into those big amber eyes, I just can't stay mad. At least she doesn't shoot me nearly as many judgmental glances as Yeti.   </p>
