Project purpose:
A photo gallery celebrating the judgmental dogs in our lives with a submission form
NOTE: Because we aren't far enough along in javascript to build the backend of a form, I was told to just create the front end.

Features:
1. Create a responsive menu with CSS
2. Run PageSpeed Insights from google.com get a score of 60 or better
3. Add your own transition animation(s) to an element on hover
