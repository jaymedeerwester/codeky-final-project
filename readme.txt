Project purpose:
A photo gallery celebrating the judgmental dogs in our lives with a submission form
NOTE: Because we aren't far enough along in javascript to build the backend of a form, I was told to just create the front end.

1. Create a responsive menu with CSS
2. Run PageSpeed Insights from google.com get a score of 60 or better: https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-github-com-jaymedeerwester-codeky-final-project-index-html/fh8ignpus1?form_factor=mobile
